# 1 dsp the basics

on Digital signals and Fourier transforms

## 1.1 what is signal processing

signal = description of the evolution of a physical phenomenon

e.g.
weather = temperature(t)
sound = pressure(t)
        or voltage(t)
or light intensity = light(r)

processing = analysis and synthesis

digital paradigm = discrete time and discrete amplitude

discrete time very practical
discrete average = sum not integral

-> with V set of values
x: Z -> V instead of f: R -> V

Sampling theorem

x(t) = sum_n=-inf^inf x[n] sinc((t - n Ts) / Ts)
= shift and scale sinc function

at _some_ condition

discrete amplitude interesting too
just think about analog processing vs digital processing
easy storage => easy transmission
cpus good at working with integers
and general purpose storage vs many analog formats

dsp has made the most difference in data transmission
noise elimination and gain compensation
easy to decode noisy binary
any negative V => low state, any positive V => high state
= threshold operator
very important for eu-us cable transmission
insane advancements in transatlantic data throughput
5 bps -> 3 Mbps -> 8 Tbps -> 60 Tbps

key ides:
discrete time
-> samples vs ideal model
-> simple math vs calculus in R

discrete values:
-> general purpose storage
-> general purpose processor = CPU
-> noise control

## 1.2 discrete time signals

signal = sequence of complexe numbers

- 1D for now
- notated x[n]
- two sided, x: Z -> C
- n adimensional "time", no unit, just here to order
- analysis -> periodic measurement
- synthesis -> stream of generated samples eg synth

simple signals:

delta signal 
delta[0] = 1
delta[n] = 0 otherwise

unit step
u[n >= 0] = 1
u[n < 0]  = 0

exponential decay
with |a| < 1
u[n] = |a|^n u[n]
note the unit step

sinusoid
x[n] = sin(w.n + th)

four classes of signal
- finite length
- infinite length
- periodic 
- finite support

### finite length signal

- sequence notation
    - x[n], n=0, ..., N - 1
    - always specify the range of indices
- vector notation
    - **x** = [x0 ... xN-1]T


nice for computation but annoying for processing
bc the length ends up everywhere

### inifinte length

- x[n], n in Z

inpractical for computation but good for theorems

### periodic sequences

N periodic

- tilde x[n] = tilde x[n + k.N], n k N in Z

same info as finite length signal of length N
bridges between finite and infinite

### Finite support

infinite length but finite number of non zero samples

bar x[n in 0..N-1] = x[n]
bar x[else] = 0

also bridges bw finite and infinite

### elementary opertors

scaling
summation
product
delay/shift (careful with finite length signal)
    - needs embedding
    - compact support = zero padding
    - or periodic = circular shift

### Energy and power

E_x = sum (n in Z) of |x[n]|^2
P_x = lim (N->+inf) of (1 / 2N+1) local energy on [[-N, N]]

nb:
periodic signals have infinite energy but finite power
power = power over a period 
= 1/N sum n=0..N |x[n]|^2

## 1.3 basic signal processing

### 1.3a how your pc plays discrete time sounds

computer = fully functional signal processing unit
with interfaces to visualise
-> plot 
-> playback
sound card as da converter

eg sine x[n] = sin(w.n + th)

sample rate fs -> sample period Ts = 1/fs
N-periodic signal -> N.Ts sec periodic signal
-> frequency f = 1/(M.Ts) = fs / M Hz

### 1.3b the karplus strong algorithm

DSP has building blocks that you can combine

blocks:
- adder
- multiplier
- delay
    - unit delay z-1
    - arbitrary delay z-N

e.g. the moving average
y[n] = 1/2 * (x[n] + x[n - 1])

```
x[n] ---------------(+)--------0.5----> y[n]
     |               Λ
     |               |
     |               |
     ------z^-1-------
```

moving average of delta
y[n < 0] = y[n > 2] = 0

y[n] = 0.5(delta[n] + delta[n - 1])

moving average of delta
y[n < 0] = 0
y[0] = 0.5
y[n >= 1] = 1

exercise: show that moving average of sine gives sine with phase delay


what if we reverse the loop
```
x[n] -----(+)-------------------------------> y[n]
           Λ                  |
           |                  |
           |                  |
           ----a---z^-1--------
```

y[n] = ay[n - 1] + x[n]
recursive algorithm
where do we start
-> set zero initial conditions
-> set a start time, assume all inputs and outputs zeros before start time are filled with 0

eg compound interest
with 5% interest

balance
y[n] = x[n] + 1.05y[n - 1]

if x[n] = 100delta[n]
y[n] = (1.05)^n * 100 u[n]

now with general delay
```
x[n] -----(+)-------------------------------> y[n]
           Λ                  |
           |                  |
           |                  |
           ----a---z^-M--------
```
y[n] = x[n] + ay[n - M]

equivalent to having M buffers that can contain one value each
