# 1 dsp the basics

on Digital signals and Fourier transforms

## 1.1 what is signal processing

signal = description of the evolution of a physical phenomenon

e.g.
weather = temperature(t)
sound = pressure(t)
        or voltage(t)
or light intensity = light(r)

processing = analysis and synthesis

audio: f(t), what is f ?
