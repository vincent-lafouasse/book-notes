# 1 dsp the basics

on Digital signals and Fourier transforms

## 1.1 what is signal processing

signal = description of the evolution of a physical phenomenon

e.g.
weather = temperature(t)
sound = pressure(t)
        or voltage(t)
or light intensity = light(r)

processing = analysis and synthesis

digital paradigm = discrete time and discrete amplitude

discrete time very practical
discrete average = sum not integral

-> with V set of values
x: Z -> V instead of f: R -> V

Sampling theorem

x(t) = sum_n=-inf^inf x[n] sinc((t - n Ts) / Ts)
= shift and scale sinc function

at _some_ condition

discrete amplitude interesting too
just think about analog processing vs digital processing
easy storage => easy transmission
cpus good at working with integers

dsp has made the most difference in data transmission
