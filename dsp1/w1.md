# 1 dsp the basics

on Digital signals and Fourier transforms

## 1.1 what is signal processing

signal = description of the evolution of a physical phenomenon

e.g.
weather = temperature(t)
sound = pressure(t)
        or voltage(t)
or light intensity = light(r)

processing = analysis and synthesis

digital paradigm = discrete time and discrete amplitude

discrete time very practical
discrete average = sum not integral

-> with V set of values
x: Z -> V instead of f: R -> V

Sampling theorem

x(t) = sum_n=-inf^inf x[n] sinc((t - n Ts) / Ts)
= shift and scale sinc function

at _some_ condition

discrete amplitude interesting too
just think about analog processing vs digital processing
easy storage => easy transmission
cpus good at working with integers
and general purpose storage vs many analog formats

dsp has made the most difference in data transmission
noise elimination and gain compensation
easy to decode noisy binary
any negative V => low state, any positive V => high state
= threshold operator
very important for eu-us cable transmission
insane advancements in transatlantic data throughput
5 bps -> 3 Mbps -> 8 Tbps -> 60 Tbps

key ides:
discrete time
-> samples vs ideal model
-> simple math vs calculus in R

discrete values:
-> general purpose storage
-> general purpose processor = CPU
-> noise control

## 1.2 discrete time signals

signal = sequence of complexe numbers

- 1D for now
- notated x[n]
- two sided, x: Z -> C
- n adimensional "time", no unit, just here to order
- analysis -> periodic measurement
- synthesis -> stream of generated samples eg synth

simple signals:

the delta signal 
delta[0] = 1
delta[n] = 0 otherwise

the unit step
u[n >= 0] = 1
u[n < 0]  = 0

the exponential decay
with |a| < 1
u[n >= 0] = |a|^n u[n]
u[n < 0]  = 0
