## 1 Sounds and signals

signal = f(t)
e.g. sound = p(t)

mic p(t) -> v(t)
-> is a transducer, it converts

all this also applies to signals that vary in space, e.g. images and video

### 1.1 Periodic signals

not much to say

### 1.2 Spectral decomposition

DFT Discrete Fourier Transform
by FFT

### 1.3 Signals
